<blockquote>
<p>“Every one of us is responsible for the culture and reputation of our Army and the environment in which we work. <strong>If you become aware of any individual degrading another, then show moral courage and take a stand against it.</strong> No one has EVER explained to me how the exploitation or degradation of others, enhances capability, or honours the traditions of the Australian Army.</p>
<p>I will be ruthless in ridding the army of people who cannot live up to it’s values. And I need every one of you to support me in achieving this. <strong>The standard you walk past, is the standard you accept.</strong> That goes for all of us, but especially those, who by their rank, have a leadership role.”</p>
