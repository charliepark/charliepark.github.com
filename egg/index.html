  <h1>Egg</h1>
<p>by C.G. Hanzlicek</p>
<p>I’m scrambling an egg for my daughter.<br />
“Why are you always whistling?” she asks.<br />
“Because I’m happy.”<br />
And it’s true,<br />
Though it stuns me to say it aloud;<br />
There was a time when I wouldn’t<br />
Have seen it as my future.<br />
It’s partly a matter<br />
Of who is there to eat the egg:<br />
The self fallen out of love with itself<br />
Through the tedium of familiarity,<br />
Or this little self,<br />
So curious, so hungry,<br />
Who emerged from the woman I love,<br />
A woman who loves me in a way<br />
I’ve come to think I deserve,<br />
Now that it arrives from outside me.<br />
Everything changes, we’re told,<br />
And now the changes are everywhere:<br />
The house with its morning light<br />
That fills me like a revelation,<br />
The yard with its trees<br />
That cast a bit more shade each summer,<br />
The love of a woman<br />
That both is and isn’t confounding,<br />
And the love<br />
Of this clamor of questions at my waist.<br />
Clamor of questions,<br />
You clamor of answers,<br />
Here’s your egg.<br /></p>
