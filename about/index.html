  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there. I’m Charlie. I live in San Francisco and write code, but that’s the boring bit. I’m at my best when on an adventure with my family. So I try to optimize for that. We drove across the country (twice! so far!) during a pandemic, we go camping whenever we can, and we’re always up for a good hike.</p>

<h2>Work Stuff</h2>
<p>Work-wise, I’m a frontend engineer (but I’ve also spent time in people management, and my team loved me — the team I led had a CultureAmp engagement score of 95%, which is one of the highest in the industry). I’ve worked at Slack and IFTTT, and currently run my own indie personal finance webapp.</p>
<p>I enjoy developing performant, accessible sites, and am comfortable with JavaScript (both React and vanilla JS, including ES6+ features/syntax), Typescript, semantic HTML, and modern CSS, (like flexbox, CSS grid, etc.).</p>
<p><strong class="highlight">I’m currently looking to join a team of thoughtful, enthusiastic, friendly people, as a frontend engineer. I’d love to chat with you, if that sounds like your team!</strong> My email’s charlie@charliepark.org.
<h2>This Tumblelog</h2>
<p>I created the framework for this tumblelog (using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>) because I wanted to get to know the software a bit better, wanted to play around with <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and wanted to post more on my site. It was feeling kind of staid, and it felt like things had to be <em>just right</em> to merit posting. That’s silly. So! A tumblelog.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in an Eleventy-based tumblelog like this one, you’re welcome to check out <a href="https://github.com/charliepark/tumblelog">the code</a>, though I need to polish it up a bit before it works out of the box.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>My email is charlie@charliepark.org. You’re also welcome to connect with me via a DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/charliepark">Twitter</a>. I’m not posting there much, but DMs are a handy way to connect. So say hi!</p>
