  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there. I’m Charlie. I live in San Francisco and write code, but that’s the boring bit. I’m at my best when on an adventure with my family. So I try to optimize for that.</p>
<p>This is me with a beard. I no longer have a beard.</p>

<h2>Work Stuff</h2>
<p>Work-wise, I’m a frontend engineer (but I’ve also spent time in people management, and my team loved me — the team I led had a CultureAmp engagement score of 95%, which is one of the highest in the industry). I’m at <a href="https://launchdarkly.com">LaunchDarkly</a>, but past-me worked at Slack, IFTTT, and at an indie personal finance webapp I built called <a href="https://pearbudget.com">PearBudget</a>.</p>
<h2>This Tumblelog</h2>
<p>I created the framework for this tumblelog (using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>) because blogging had gotten boring. I had been feeling like things I wrote had to be <em>just right</em> to merit posting. That’s silly. So! A tumblelog.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in an Eleventy-based tumblelog like this one, you’re welcome to check out <a href="https://github.com/charliepark/tumblelog">the code</a>, though I need to polish it up a bit before it works out of the box.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
