        <h2 class="screenreader">Intro</h2>
        <p>Hey there! <span aria-hidden="true">👋</span></p>
        <p>I’m a frontend engineer in Oakland, California. I’m currently at LaunchDarkly. Previously, I was an engineer at Slack and IFTTT. I also founded and ran a personal finance webapp for several years.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="screenreader">What I’m looking for</h2>
        <p>I love a lot about LaunchDarkly, but we’ve both grown a lot over the last couple of years and I’m open to new opportunities. Here are some of the things I’m thinking about when considering where I want to work.</p>
        <h3>People</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Are the people kind? Humble? Friendly?</li>
          <li>Is the team diverse? Are the founders and execs women and/or people of color? (This one is really important to me.)</li>
          <li>Do people from under-represented groups feel like their voices are heard? Are their voices sought out / amplified?</li>
          <li>Do people lift one another up, and do they help everyone improve? Are they quick to share what they know? Can people communicate well?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Is the company’s culture healthy and do the values mean something to them? Will they commit to their values even if it means they might lose business?</li>
          <li>Are there healthy manager / IC relationships?</li>
          <li>Does the product development team actively seek input from the support and sales teams, to better understand their customers’ needs?</li>
          <li>Is the business side of the house both sustainable and humane? What does the trajectory look like?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Product</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Does the product make the world a better place?</li>
          <li>Is the UX delightful?</li>
          <li>Does the team prioritize accessibility, so everyone can use their product?</li>
          <li>(Not a hard requirement, but do they have a Content Designer / UX Writer on the team? At the very least, do they understand that words are a critical part of good design?)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="screenreader">What I do well</h2>
        <p>As to the specific work I do … the stack I’m currently working in is React and Typescript, but I’ve also worked with PHP, Ruby, and Rails in the past. My favorite stack is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. I think a lot about accessibility and good UX, and actively avoid “clever” code.</p>
