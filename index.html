        <p>Hey there!</p>
        <p>I’m a frontend engineer in Oakland, California. I’m currently at LaunchDarkly. Previously, I was an engineer at Slack and IFTTT. I also founded and ran a personal finance startup for several years.</p>
        <p>I love a lot about LaunchDarkly, but have been here for a few years and am open to new opportunities.</p>

      <section>
        <p>Here are some of the things I’m thinking about when considering where I want to work.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Are the people kind? Humble? Friendly?</li>
          <li>Is the team diverse? Are the founders and execs women and/or people of color? (This one is really important to me.)</li>
          <li>Do people from under-represented groups feel like their voices are heard? Are their voices sought out / amplified?</li>
          <li>Do people lift one another up, and do they help everyone improve? Are they quick to share what they know? Can people communicate well?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Is the company’s culture healthy and do the values mean something to them? Will they commit to their values even if it means they might lose business?</li>
          <li>Are there healthy manager / IC relationships?</li>
          <li>Does the product development team actively seek input from the support team, to better understand their customers’ needs?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Product</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Does the product make the world a better place?</li>
          <li>Is the UX delightful?</li>
          <li>Does the team prioritize accessibility, so everyone can use their product?</li>
          <li>(Not a hard requirement, but do they have a Content Designer / UX Writer on the team? At the very least, do they understand that words are a critical part of good design?)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
