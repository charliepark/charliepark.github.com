        <h2 class="screenreader">Intro</h2>
        <p>Hey there! <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ‘‹</span></p>
        <p>Iâ€™m a frontend engineer in Oakland, California. Iâ€™m currently at LaunchDarkly. Previously, I was an engineer at Slack and IFTTT. I also founded and ran a personal finance webapp for several years.</p>

        <h2 class="screenreader">What Iâ€™m looking for</h2>
        <p>I think a lot about work culture, and what goes into creating a place where people can both do excellent work and can flourish and grow as humans.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m working on a longer piece, but for now, here are some of the things Iâ€™m thinking about:</p>
        <h3>People</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Are the people kind? Humble? Friendly?</li>
          <li>Is the team diverse? Are the founders and execs women and/or people of color? (This one is really important to me.)</li>
          <li>Do people from under-represented groups feel like their voices are heard? Are their voices sought out / amplified?</li>
          <li>Do people lift one another up, and do they help everyone improve? Are they quick to share what they know? Can people communicate well?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Is the companyâ€™s culture healthy and do the values mean something to them? Will they commit to their values even if it means they might lose business?</li>
          <li>Are there healthy manager / IC relationships?</li>
          <li>Does the product development team actively seek input from the support and sales teams, to better understand their customersâ€™ needs?</li>
          <li>Is the business side of the house both sustainable and humane? What does the trajectory look like?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Product</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Does the product make the world a better place?</li>
          <li>Is the UX delightful?</li>
          <li>Does the team prioritize accessibility, so everyone can use their product?</li>
          <li>(Not a hard requirement, but do they have a Content Designer / UX Writer on the team? At the very least, do they understand that words are a critical part of good design?)</li>
        </ul>
