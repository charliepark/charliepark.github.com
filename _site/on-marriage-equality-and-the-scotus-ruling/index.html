	<p>I’ve had two primary thoughts today about the Supreme Court’s ruling on <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em> and the general response to it on social media (particularly from companies).</p>

<p>First: I’m thrilled about the ruling, and hope it gives further momentum to the flywheel of justice. There’s so much work yet to be done.</p>

<p>Second: Corporations changing their icons and avatars to feature rainbows feels crass and opportunistic. I appreciate the spirit of celebration, but they’ve co-opted a symbol they aren’t worthy of, and applied it in what feels like an offensively pedestrian way.</p>

<p>Rainbow flags and other symbols of gay pride are for <em>people</em>. People who’ve been forced to love each other in secret. People who’ve been ostracized from their families, churches, and communities. People who’ve sat by the bedsides of loved ones with AIDS, and had to watch them die. I bristle at anything that gives corporations more person-like qualities, especially in the context of this decades long fight that has been, at its core, <em>personal</em>.</p>

<p>As Wendell Berry says in <em>The Total Economy</em>, “The folly at the root of this foolish economy began with the idea that a corporation should be regarded, legally, as ‘a person.’ But the limitless destructiveness of this economy comes about precisely because a corporation is <em>not</em> a person. A corporation, essentially, is a pile of money to which a number of persons have sold their moral allegiance. Unlike a person, a corporation does not age. It does not arrive, as most persons finally do, at a realization of the shortness and smallness of human lives; it does not come to see the future as the lifetime of the children and grandchildren of anybody in particular. It can experience no personal hope or remorse, no change of heart. It cannot humble itself. It goes about its business as if it were immortal, with the single purpose of becoming a bigger pile of money.”</p>

<p>Corporations putting rainbows on their Twitter and Facebook avatars feels like they are claiming a role in the victory — by fiddling with Photoshop for ten minutes — that people have been fighting and dying for for over 50 years. It feels cheap.</p>

<p>But I don’t mean to diminish joy on what is, again, a wonderful day. I hope everyone has an amazing Pride weekend!</p>
