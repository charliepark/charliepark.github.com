  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Ruby 1.9.3 revamped the Date class, and the info in this post is now out of date. In fact, it&rsquo;s now totally wrong. <strong>If you&rsquo;re using Ruby 1.9.3, it&rsquo;s faster to call Date.today than Time.now.</strong></p>
  <p>♪ ♫ The more you know.</p>
</div>

<p>There are often times when I can handle a programming issue in one of two (or more) ways. Dealing with Time / Date objects is one of those situations.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to know what day today is, you can either fetch Date.today.day or Time.now.day.</p>

<p>In my head, Date is a much simpler concept than Time. After all, Time deals with things like milliseconds and Epochs and things like that, where Date … well, I woke up this morning, and it was today’s date. And when I get up tomorrow, it’ll be tomorrow’s date. “Date” seems much more tangible.</p>

<p>I was curious, though, to know if there was a difference in how quickly Ruby could process the two. So I ran a test.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-test">The First Test</h3>

<p>I was in a Rails app, so I fired up script/console, and added the following code:</p>

<pre><code>require 'benchmark'

Benchmark.ms { 1000.times { puts Time.now } }

Benchmark.ms { 1000.times { puts Date.today } }
</code></pre>

<h3 id="the-results">The Results</h3>

<p>What I found was really interesting.</p>

<p>I ran the test a couple of times, and the average processing time for Time.now was 104 ms. The average processing time for Date.today was 251 ms.</p>

<p>That means it took Date.today about two and a half times as long to get processed than Time.now.</p>

<h3 id="the-second-test">The Second Test</h3>

<p>I was curious to see if those results would hold if I ran a more complicated test. So I made the processing a tiny bit trickier:</p>

<pre><code>def month_name_t(month = Time.now.month)
  Date::MONTHNAMES[month]
end
Benchmark.ms { 1000.times { month_name_t } }

def month_name_d(month = Date.today.month)
  Date::MONTHNAMES[month]
end
Benchmark.ms { 1000.times { month_name_d } }
</code></pre>

<h3 id="more-results">More Results</h3>

<p>This time around, the difference was even more pronounced.</p>

<p>On average, month_name_t (Time.now) took 2 ms. And month_name_d (Date.today) took 80 ms.</p>

<p>So when we made the function just a bit more complex, it increased the processing time dramatically: <strong>Date.today took 40 times as long to process as Time.now.</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h3>

<p><strike>When you're processing Times and Dates in your app, and you don't *need* to use the Date object for some reason, use Time.</strike></p>
