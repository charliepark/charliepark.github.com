	<p>I recently noticed an interesting pattern.</p>

<p>On days when I’m on Twitter, my ability to focus and get good work done falls off a cliff.</p>

<p>It’s not just “when you read Twitter first-thing in the day”, something I’ve heard people discuss. It was that I was on Twitter at all.</p>

<p>I think there are a few things going on with this.</p>

<p>First, <strong>I want to be liked</strong>. If I post something on Twitter, it’s pretty common for me to check back in on that tweet several times, hoping for someone to favorite or retweet it.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>I want to find interesting friends</strong>. If someone favorites or retweets my tweet, I usually click through to find out more about them. Or if I’m reading my feed and one of you retweets something from someone interesting, I often click through to find out more about <em>your</em> friends. Maybe they’ll be my friend, too!</p>

<p>Third, <strong>I want to stay in the loop</strong>. It’s incredibly easy to rationalize this: I need to stay on top of the latest technologies; I need to know what’s happening in different startups; I need to know about what’s going on in the wider world. In truth, though, the important things will still find their way to me, via channels other than Twitter.</p>

<p>Fourth, <strong>I want to be entertained</strong>. Much of the stuff that comes across my feed is interesting and funny. What? New trailer for <em>The Martian</em>? Great! A video of Amy Schumer being funny? Bring it! New XKCD strip? That’ll just take a second! And yet, it never does.</p>

<p>I took a break from Twitter for a few weeks earlier this year. It felt really good. I felt like I was getting more and better work done.</p>

<p>And then, really easily, I fell back into Twitter. It was natural. After all, who doesn’t want to be liked, have friends, and be informed and entertained?</p>

<p>But I noticed that my work suffered.</p>

<p>So I’ve taken a break again, this time for the rest of June. We’ll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Here’s hoping for more and better work getting done.</p>
