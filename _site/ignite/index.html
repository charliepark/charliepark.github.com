<div class="update_box">
<p>This is a lightning talk I gave at an Ignite event in May, 2015. Ignite talks are five minutes long, with slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds. They move quickly.</p>

<p>Before giving it, I got input from people with as many different perspectives as possible — women and men, trans and cis, gay and straight, PoC and white, single and married, non-parents and parents. I tried to be mindful of people in other communities as well. In no way does that mean I covered all perspectives, or that I covered the topics as deeply or as nuanced as I could have, or that I even made good choices in what to talk about. (I'm working on a post about what I could/should have said.) I'm trying to get better at this; <b>if you think I missed something important in the talk below, I'd genuinely love to hear from you: charlie@charliepark.org.</b></p>
</div>

<p>My name’s Charlie Park, and I’m an engineer at IFTTT.</p>

<p>Before I start: there’s a transcript of this talk and an annotated audio version at <a href="http://charliepark.org/ignite">charliepark.org/ignite</a>, if you prefer those.</p>

<p><img alt="A slide with the words 'Two hard problems'." src="/images/ignite/02.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>You’ve maybe heard the joke: “The two hardest problems in computer science are cache invalidation and naming things.” Not a great joke, but we’ll roll with it. Why is naming things hard? Because words <em>matter</em>. They’re nuanced and subtle. If you write a program and use the wrong word in the wrong context, it can have big consequences.</p>

<p>There’s a word that a lot of people use incorrectly, and it’s causing problems. We’re going to talk about it.</p>

<p><img alt="A slide with the word 'females'." src="/images/ignite/03.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>People want to hire more women. That’s good!
People say “We’re looking for females.” That’s not good!</p>

<p>We’ll talk about why in a second, but first, there are three contexts where referring to a human woman as a “female” is okay.</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing three people: a police officer (actor Reginald VelJohnson as Carl Winslow from the TV show 'Family Matters'), a doctor (actor Mindy Kaling, as Dr. Mindy Lahiri on the TV show 'The Mindy Project'), and the singer from the theme song to the TV show 'The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt' (comedian Mike Britt)." src="/images/ignite/04.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>You are a police officer, describing a suspect or a victim.</p>

<p>You are a doctor, describing a patient.</p>

<p>You’re this guy, in the intro theme to Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, singing “Females is strong as hell.”</p>

<p>So why is “female” the wrong word? A few reasons.</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing a few guppies in a fish tank." src="/images/ignite/05.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>First, “female” is a biological term, focused on sex-specific characteristics. For example, “male guppies are smaller than female guppies.” Describing <em>humans</em> based on their sexual characteristics is creepy and inappropriate.</p>

<p>By saying “female engineer”, you’re saying the fact that she has a vagina is why she has special value. Can you see why that’s offensive?</p>

<p><img alt="A slide divided into three vertical stripes. On the left, a black stripe; in the middle a rainbow stripe; on the right a stripe that resembles the Japanese flag." src="/images/ignite/06.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>Second, you’re using an adjective in place of a noun. You wouldn’t say, “we need to hire a Black.” Or “we need to hire a gay.” Or “we need to hire a Japanese.”</p>

<p>You shouldn’t say “we need to hire a female.”</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing two frames from a comic strip of a little girl (portrayed as a rabbit) with hearing aids in her ears, imagining a conversation between her classmates: Frame 1: One classmate says to the other 'You know Cece?' Friend replies: 'You mean that deaf kid?' Frame 2: First classmate: 'No, I mean the smartest kid in the whole school!'" src="/images/ignite/07.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>Third, you’re overemphasizing a particular aspect of that person’s identity.</p>

<p>This book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/El-Deafo-Cece-Bell/dp/1419712179?tag=charpark-20">El Deafo</a></em>, is about a girl who goes deaf. She doesn’t want to be singled out because of her deafness, but because of what she can do. The fact that she uses hearing aids isn’t what defines her.</p>

<p>Speaking of girls …</p>

<p><img alt="A slide with the word 'girls' on it, crossed out." src="/images/ignite/08.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>You should probably also remove the word “girls” from your vocabulary. There are organizations that help women and girls learn to code, and they have the word “girls” in their titles. I’m not talking about them. I’m talking to you, dudes, who are looking for the right word to use.</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing Ruby code that outputs the results described in the next block of text. The specific code: def proper_word(age) return 'girl' if age &lt; 13; return 'teenager' if age &lt; 18; return 'woman'; end" src="/images/ignite/09.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>It’s pretty straightforward. If you’re talking about someone under 13, she’s a girl. Older than 13 but under 18, she’s a teenager. Otherwise, she’s a woman.</p>

<p>When you use “females”, to talk about “women”, you end up sounding like …</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing the character Quark from the TV show Star Trek." src="/images/ignite/10.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>Quark, a Ferengi from the show Star Trek. You sound <em>creepy</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, Zoe Quinn made <a href="http://www.beesgo.biz/chrome.html">a great Chrome extension</a> that replaces occurrences of the word “females” with Quark’s head. So you get this:</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing a question from Reddit that says 'LPT: Straight guys, the smallest things you can do to increase the attention you get from females is work on your hair, clothes, nails and shoes.' The word 'females' has a picture of Quark's face before and after it." src="/images/ignite/11.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>You want a Life Pro Tip, buddy? I’ve got one. Don’t call women “females”.</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing the words 'wat do?'" src="/images/ignite/12.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>But I don’t want to just rip on people, I want to give some productive tips, too.</p>

<p>Instead of asking “how can we get more ‘females’ to work here?”, you should ask, “what can we do to make our workplace more approachable and accessible for <em>everyone</em>?” When you begin to focus on accessibility and empathy, you come up with better ideas.</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing Salvador Dalí's painting 'The Persistence of Memory', showing a landscape with clocks melting." src="/images/ignite/13.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>Find ways that your office can be more flexible, so people can have a life outside of work. Flexible schedules, so fathers and mothers can be with their families. Or flexible locations, so people can work from home when they need to.</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing a map of San Francisco with dots representing different crimes committed in those neighborhoods." src="/images/ignite/14.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>For the people who <em>are</em> at the office, make sure it’s in a part of town where people feel safe, especially if people stay late.</p>

<p>As for ideas that especially benefit women …</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing nicely-designed milk pumping rooms." src="/images/ignite/15.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>If a woman has just had a baby and wants to come back to work, she needs a place where she can pump milk. Not in a bathroom, not in a conference room with glass walls. Have a safe, peaceful space where women can pump milk.</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing the logo for Tampon Club, an illustrated tampon with the words 'Tampon Club' across it." src="/images/ignite/16.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>Your office has Kleenex, right? You should have pads and tampons, too. Otherwise you might get a visit from <a href="http://www.tampon.club/">Tampon Club</a>, an awesome secret society of women that leaves pads and tampons in offices that should provide them.</p>

<p>I’m sure they’d love to be put out of work!</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing a cross-stitched embroidery sampler with the text 'If you sprinkle while you tinkle, fucking clean it up." src="/images/ignite/17.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>Ultimately, it’s about respect and empathy. People want their value recognized. People want to have a voice.</p>

<p>And when you focus on being more approachable and accessible, you aren’t just going to make things better for women, but for people of color, for people with alternate sexualities, for everyone.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/images/ignite/18.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>So, to sum up:</p>

<p>One, stop calling women “females”.</p>

<p>Two, work to make your workplace more accessible and approachable for <em>everyone</em>.</p>

<p>There are women in your office <em>today</em> who feel marginalized and devalued.</p>

<p>There’s a generation of women coming down the road who haven’t hit those roadblocks yet, but who will if things don’t change.</p>

<p>Things need to change. Words matter. Altering the words you use will help with that change.</p>

<p><img alt="A slide showing a picture of a 10-year-old girl, flying a small plane." src="/images/ignite/19.jpg" style="margin:0 auto;max-width:100%" /></p>

<p>My daughters are awesome. Here’s Lucy, flying a plane last year at a “Women in Aviation” week. Ask my 8-year-old daughter Frances what she wants to be when she grows up, she doesn’t say she wants to be an engineer; she says she wants to <em>keep being</em> an engineer.</p>

<p>They are part of a generation that’s growing up, and that will, one day be <em>women</em>. So I want you, guys, to get used to the idea of working with women — not with girls, not with “females”.</p>

<p>Because, one day, maybe they will come to you … and offer you a job.</p>
