        A few notes!
        I have not gzipped this file, in case you're interested in reading it. Normally, in production, I would. Also, that tree SVG is kind of ridiculous, but I'm leaving it as-is for now.
        I'm including this CSS within the file itself, as it's a single page, and since that'll cut down on HTTP requests. Low overhead is good!
        I'm using an approach to this stylesheet that breaks the CSS into functional areas: Color, Typography, Layout, Alternate Device Styles. It's not my normal approach (I'm happy to talk about my usual approach with you if we get a chance to meet up), but I wanted to experiment with this one.

    <h1 class="salutation">Hi, Anthony, Tibbetses, Lady, and everyone else at IFTTT!</h1>
    <img class="biopic-for-tablets" src="../images/charlie_and_a_turtle.png" alt="A picture of Charlie, holding a turtle. The turtle is hiding in its shell. Charlie is investigating." style="height:120px;width:120px;" height="120" width="120">
    <p class="intro">I&rsquo;m Charlie Park. I&rsquo;d love to help IFTTT change the world. Specifically, I want to help as <b>an engineer, focusing on front-end dev work</b>. Here&rsquo;s a little about why I&rsquo;d be awesome in the role:</p>
    <h2 class="requirement">You want a generalist who learns quickly, thinks creatively, and communicates well.</h2>
    <ul class="traits">
      <li>
        <p>For the last six years, I&rsquo;ve been an indie web developer, running the full stack of a deployed, profitable, subscription-based Rails app. I&rsquo;ve gotten my hands dirty doing everything involved in that &mdash; from <b>designing the interface</b> to <b>programming the app</b> to <b>setting up and securing the server</b> to making users happy with <b>really great customer service</b>. So, really, a web generalist. Learning quickly was a prerequisite.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As to communicating well? Here&rsquo;s an awfully nice thing a former boss said about me (I&rsquo;m happy to connect you with him if you like!):</p>
        <blockquote class="quote"><p>If I could wave a magic wand and turn all the designers I work with into clones of Charlie, I would do so in an instant. He is passionate about producing excellent, clean, beautiful work; his intelligence is nimble and wide-ranging, and he communicates clearly and fluently—a skill that I&rsquo;ve found to be all too rare among web designers. When our company evaluated the work he had done for us, we found that everyone&rsquo;s product had improved when Charlie was in the room, because his creativity, enthusiasm, and work ethic energized us all.</p></blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As to creative thinking? My first job out of college was as a professional brainstormer for Fortune 500 clients. Really. I love coming up with new ideas. I also know that it&rsquo;s sometimes best to roll with a known solution. I&rsquo;m comfortable with ambiguity.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="requirement">You want someone who knows about developing for modern web clients. Who understands responsive design, MVC organization, Sass, and other emerging standards. Someone who thinks deeply about design and user experience.</h2>
    <ul class="traits">
      <li>
        <p>My most recent project has been turning a Rails app into a JS-heavy, Rails-on-the-backend-but-all-meaningful-logic-runs-on-the-client app. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun working on it. Because I wanted to know the inner workings inside and out, I custom-built mechanisms for fetching JSON data and caching it (both on the server and on the client!) and for invalidating / updating the cache (again, on both server and client!), and I thought through how to structure the code in an MVC-ish way. (It actually ended up more like View-Controller/Model/Helper, but it&rsquo;s working well.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Sass. Love it. It&rsquo;s enabled me to work on <a href="https://github.com/charliepark/classy-css">Classy</a>, a new approach to CSS architecture for web apps I&rsquo;ve been thinking through. It&rsquo;s a merging of OOCSS, SMACSS, a little bit of BEM, and my own house style (and it&rsquo;s only possible because of Sass). I&rsquo;m not convinced that this new approach is the best (I&rsquo;m still experimenting with it), but I <em>am</em> convinced that Sass is a huge leap forward in CSS authoring. I still enjoy hand-coding stuff without it, but it makes larger stylesheets a lot more enjoyable to develop and maintain.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I enjoy thinking about responsive design. I&rsquo;d enjoy doing it on a team even more. Because it&rsquo;s all about choices &mdash; What do we include in this view? How do we make it more useful for mobile users? &mdash; it&rsquo;d be a lot of fun to have those conversations with a team of other smart, considerate people, as opposed to just making the call on my own. (Though if I need to make calls on my own, I&rsquo;m cool with that, too.) (This page is responsive, in case you&rsquo;re interested.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I really enjoy crafting good user experiences. And I get really frustrated by bad UX, poor choices, and missed opportunities. I just rented a Prius for a week and drove it about 2,000 miles. So much of the car was delightful. The audio control console, however, was abysmal, and would be enough to keep me from buying the car. How awful of Toyota! How sad <em>for</em> Toyota! The turd of an interface soured the whole experience of an otherwise gem of a car.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="pitch">We should talk!</h2>
    <p>So … I&rsquo;m ready to make something awesome with you if you are. I&rsquo;d love to chat with you, to see if moving forward makes sense. I&rsquo;ll be traveling the last week of July and the first week of August, and while I&rsquo;ll have phone / internet connectivity, I&rsquo;d love to connect before then to get the ball rolling. Daylight&rsquo;s burning!</p>
    <p>My e-mail (the best way to reach me) is <b><a href="mailto:charlie@charliepark.org">charlie@charliepark.org</a></b>; my phone is <b><a href="tel:+1-804-814-2064">1.804.814.2064</a></b>.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts. Can&rsquo;t wait to talk!</p>

<span class="title-sidebar-sub">When I&rsquo;m Not Thinking About Web Stuff</span></h2>
      <p>I enjoy thinking about <em>intentionality</em>. Why do we do the things we do? Why do we avoid the things we avoid? How can we modify our behavior and our habits so we can align how we <em>want</em> to live, how we <em>think</em> we live, and how we <em>actually</em> live?</p>
      <p>I also love being outside. Hiking is awesome. Camping is great, too. I enjoy cycling, but don&rsquo;t do it enough. Really, just being in the woods is enough to make me happy. I long for the day when I can rock climb and whitewater kayak again. Hopefully, that&rsquo;s not far off.</p>
