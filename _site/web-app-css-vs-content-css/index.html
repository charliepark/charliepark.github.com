	<p>The ever-impressive Harry Roberts tweeted something this morning that touched on something I’ve thought about a bit. His tweet catalyzed my thoughts, and I thought I’d share.</p>

<p>So, in a past life, I was a book designer. I did a little bit of cover design, but what I really loved was the interior design. Laying out the text block and the measure. Selecting the type face and weights. Getting just the right text size and line height. Adjusting the hyphenation and letter-spacing on paragraphs to eliminate widows and orphans, and doing my best to end chapters in just the right way so the new chapter could start on the recto. Changing the kerning and making sure the ligatures were all correct.</p>

<p>It was art and science and craft, all rolled into one. Like chess, or go, or CSS, it takes a few minutes to get the basics, and years of sweating the details to really get everything sorted out in your brain, let alone on the page in front of you.</p>

<p>The thing about books, though — and, specifically, book design — is that there are common conventions across the kinds of books you design, but there are also key distinctions in how you think about and construct the design layer.</p>

<p>Just look at your own bookshelf and you’ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>Poetry books have very different needs from fiction. DIY construction manuals are very different from cookbooks, even though they often share a similar goal. Fiction for kids and fiction for adults — technically similar in many ways — have very different structural requirements.</p>

<p>As an example, consider this layout from the book version of David Foster Wallace’s article, <em>Host</em> (the magazine layout for that piece inspired <a href="https://github.com/charliepark/parentheticals#parentheticals">this jQuery plugin of mine, Parentheticals</a>).</p>

<p>That’s very different from, say, this Cooking Illustrated page (sourced from http://rubypbds502.blogspot.com/2010/10/cooking-uses-recipe-layout-uses-grid.html).</p>

<p>And that’s different than a workbook where you </p>

<p>Anyway, you get the idea. You know what books look like.</p>

<p>This is actually a draft. If I accidentally post this on my blog … oops! Let me know! :)</p>
